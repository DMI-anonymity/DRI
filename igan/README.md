# Imagination GAN

The motivation for this work is to train a [Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network) which takes in an image of a given class (e.g. a specific letter in an alphabet) and outputs another image of the same class that is sufficiently different looking than the input. This GAN is then used as a tool for data augmentation in continual learning.
